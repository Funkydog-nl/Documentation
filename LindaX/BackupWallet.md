# LindaX - Backup your wallet
Backing up your wallet is the most important thing you have to do! If you lose access to your wallet, then you lose access to your funds!

## Backup
In the LindaX application go to File > Backup > Accounts or go directly to the %appdata%/LindaX/keystore folder and copy all the wallet files and paste these files in a secure location (like a USB stick dedicated for wallet backups).

Note: Make sure you remember your wallet passwords!

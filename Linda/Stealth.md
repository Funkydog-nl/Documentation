# Linda - Stealth
Linda has stealth transactions already fully working. Stealth means that nobody can track your transaction - after it is complete there is no record of which wallet it went to.

## Configuration
In your wallet click on the receive tab
Create a new address
Label it as Stealth (or whatever you like)
Tick the Stealth Address box 
Press OK

You're now set up with a stealth address for receiving or sending coins which for you want no record kept.

## Staking
You can't stake funds you have received on a stealth address.

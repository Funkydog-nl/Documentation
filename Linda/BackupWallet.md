# Linda - Backup your wallet
Backing up your wallet is the most important thing you have to do! If you lose access to your wallet, then you lose access to your funds!

Once your wallet is open, click on "File" and "Backup Wallet". 

Select a secure location, not on your PC (like an USB stick you don't use for other things). 

Press "Save" to finish the backup proccess.

# Linda - Coin Control

Every time your coins stake they get split into two. Also, as you send more coins to your wallet they stake as separate parcels of coins. A good practice to improve the speed of creating blocks is to use ‘coin control’, which is basically sending your own coins from your wallet back to your wallet (instantaneous) as one parcel.

Go to Settings > Options > Display > Enable coin control
Go to send tab and click inputs
Select all coins you have and click OK
Copy and paste your wallet address from receive coins tab
Enter in the after-fee amount and hit send
Your coins should stake as one amount after maturing
You can repeat this after every stake to keep your coins as one parcel
